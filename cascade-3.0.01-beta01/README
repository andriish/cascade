with (as example):
lhapdf="/Users/jung/MCgenerators/lhapdf/5.9.1" 
pythia6="/Users/jung/MCgenerators/pythia6/428" 
tmdlib="/Users/jung/jung/cvs/TMDlib" 
gsl="/sw"

./configure --disable-shared --prefix=/Users/jung/jung/cvs/cascade2/cascade-2.4/local --with-lhapdf="/Users/jung/MCgenerators/lhapdf/5.9.1" --with-pythia6="/Users/jung/MCgenerators/pythia6/428" --with-tmdlib="/Users/jung/jung/cvs/TMDlib" --with-gsl="/sw"

export PYTHIA6_DIR=/Users/jung/MCgenerators/pythia6/428
export LHAPDF_DIR=/Users/jung/MCgenerators/lhapdf/5.9.1
export TMDLIB_DIR=/Users/jung/jung/cvs/TMDlib
export HEPMC=/Users/jung/MCgenerators/hepmc/HepMC-2.06.09/local
